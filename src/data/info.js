Streamed real-time data via HTTP IP calls and asynchronous TCP/UDP sockets for seamless transmission of 3D keypoints to Unity. Leveraging SLAM techniques in the Mobi-SLAM project, I developed a custom implementation of ORB-SLAM3, integrating camera and IMU data with GPS for accurate real-time 3D mapping and localization. Optimized the CRFNet algorithm using multi-sensor fusion, enhancing object detection reliability by 18% in dynamic environments.",
